# Siamese Neural Network for Image Verification

## Background

This project aims to implement a Siamese Neural Network for image verification, particularly focusing on comparing facial images for verification purposes. The Siamese architecture is well-suited for tasks where direct image classification may not be feasible due to limited labeled data or complex similarity metrics.

## Problem Statement

The task involves building a model capable of learning embeddings for facial images, where the objective is to determine whether two facial images belong to the same person (positive pair) or different people (negative pair). This verification process is crucial for applications requiring secure access or identity verification.

## Achievements

- Implemented a Siamese Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Trained the model on a dataset consisting of positive and negative pairs of facial images.
- Achieved promising results in terms of recall and precision metrics for image verification.
- Integrated real-time verification using OpenCV, allowing for immediate application in live scenarios.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains directories for positive, negative, and anchor images.
- `src/`: Source code for data collection, model training, and real-time verification.
- `application_data/`: Includes folders for input images and verification images used in real-time testing.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, its background, problem statement, and achievements.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure dependencies are installed (`tensorflow`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
2. **Data Collection**: Collect positive and negative facial images, and anchor images using a webcam or stored datasets.
3. **Training**: Train the Siamese model using the collected data to learn embeddings.
4. **Real-Time Verification**: Use OpenCV to perform real-time verification with the trained model.

## Future Work

- Enhance model performance with more diverse and larger datasets.
- Implement transfer learning techniques to improve generalization.
- Explore deployment options for mobile and web-based applications.
